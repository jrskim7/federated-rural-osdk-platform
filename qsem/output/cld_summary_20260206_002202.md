- Grazing_Intensity → Biomass_Stock (-): Grazing reduces biomass
- Biomass_Stock → Fire_Risk (+): More biomass increases fuel load
- Governance_Capacity → Fire_Risk (-): Better governance reduces fire risk
- Management_Capacity → Fire_Risk (-): Improved management reduces risk
- Tourism_Pressure → Fire_Risk (+): Higher tourism pressure elevates risk
- Fire_Risk → Suitability (-): Risk lowers project suitability
- Economic_Resilience → Management_Capacity (+): Revenue supports management
- Community_Governance → Management_Capacity (+): Governance improves coordination
- Water_Requirement → Suitability (-): Higher requirements reduce feasibility
